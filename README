TRACING

1- Go over the reference table page by page
2- Read the contents of the new page and compare it to the reference content
3- if NO CHANGE: do nothing
   if there is CHANGE in a block:
	if the page can still put more blocks in the diff cache, create a cacheentry object and put it in cache
		change the state of the page to semi-merged
	if the page can no longer put more entries in the cache
		check if remerge is possible (yes: you can put more blocks in th cache)
		no: mark the page as unmerged. remove its contents from the cache. remove it from the mm instance
		increase the occupied size of the machine memory
